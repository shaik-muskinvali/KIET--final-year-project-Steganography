# KIET--final-year-project-Steganography
Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information. For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of steganography techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret information, while others require a large secret message to be hidden. This project report intends to give an overview of image steganography, its uses and techniques.

TYPES OF STEGANOGRAPHY

1.Steganography in Image

2.Steganography in Audio

3.Steganography in Video

1.Steganography in Image: This involves hiding secret information within an image file. Imagine you have a picture of a cat. In steganography, 
  instead of just seeing the cat, there might be hidden text or another image concealed within the pixels of the cat picture. To the naked eye, 
  the cat picture looks normal, but with the right tools or techniques, one can extract the hidden information.

2.Steganography in Audio: Similar to image steganography, this method hides secret data within an audio file, like a song or a recording. Just 
  like how you can hide a message in an image, you can hide it within the sound waves of an audio file. It could be done by slightly altering the 
   sound frequencies or patterns, so when you listen to the song, you wouldn't notice anything different, but the hidden message is there.

3.Steganography in Video: Video steganography is the practice of concealing information within a video file. Imagine watching a video of a 
   beautiful landscape. Within the video, there might be hidden frames or data that are not visible during normal playback. It's like hiding a 
    message within the frames of the video, making it imperceptible to the viewer but retrievable with the right techniques.
